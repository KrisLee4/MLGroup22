                <!-- Introduction -->
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Any dog owner who has ventured outside with their beloved friend knows the struggles of keeping them from getting into trouble or keeping trouble from getting into them. Dogs have a habit of eating anything they can get their paws on. When it comes to just venturing outside, it’s hard to know what is or isn’t harmful to a playful pet. Being able to tell what plants are safe and which are toxic to a dog is no small task for anyone who isn’t a seasoned gardener or botanist. At best, a chance encounter with a toxic plant can cause mild irritation. At worst, it can lead to a costly trip to the vet. Therefore, we aim to create a system to assist pet owners in quickly identifying plants that could potentially pose a threat to their pooch.</p>

                <!-- Problem Definition -->
                <h3>Problem Definition</h3>
                <p>The technical goal of this project is to classify various species of plant images by training on an aggregate set of flower images obtained from various data sets from Kaggle. Using this robust dataset along with a botanical listing of all known plants toxic to dogs, we will form a final dataset upon which to train a machine learning model: one which can identify both plant species and toxicity.</p>

                <br>

                <!-- Methods -->
                <h3>Methods</h3>
                <p>The methods we plan to use for the project include:<p/>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data Scrubbing: Constructing a large database of toxic and non-toxic flowers</li>
                    <li>Image Pre-Processing: Normalizing RGB values and reshaping image arrays</li>
                    <li>Unsupervised Learning (clustering): Grouping the images on identifiable features</li>
                    <li>Supervised Learning (classification): Using x,y coordinates and RGB values of pixels as features within the images to classify each plant</li>
                    <li>We will most likely use python packages such as OpenCV and sklearn as well.</li>
                </ul>

                <br>

                <!-- Potential Results -->
                <h3>Potential Results</h3>
                <p>Our hope is that by the end of training we will have a model that can be used in determining the toxicity of plants via a single output as well as the species of the plant in a separate output. An additional goal would be in identifying a correlation between plant species and toxicity to dogs.</p>

                <!-- Discussion & Future Work -->
                <h3>Discussion & Future Work</h3>
                <p>One anticipated difficulty in the project is a collision of toxic and nontoxic plants in our predictive model. However, in absence of that issue, the project could be expanded to include more species of flowers as well as other types of plants. Furthermore, we could identify the toxicity for various other types of animals and categorize toxicity based on each species.</p>
