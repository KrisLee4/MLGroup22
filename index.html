                <!-- Introduction -->
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Any dog owner who has ventured outside with their beloved friend knows the struggles of keeping them from getting into trouble or to keep trouble from getting into them. Dogs have a habit of eating anything they can get their paws on and when it comes to just venturing outside it’s hard to what is or isn’t harmful to a playful pet. Being able to tell what plants are and are not toxic to a dog is no small task for anyone who isn’t a seasoned gardener or botanist. And a chance encounter with a toxic plant can lead to at best cause mild irritation and at worst lead to a costly trip to the vet. Therefore we aim to create a system to assist pet owners in quickly identifying plants that could potentially pose a threat to their pooch.</p>

                <p style="margin-left:33%;"><b>Image 1:</b> Tulips are toxic to dogs. </p>

                <!-- Problem Definition -->
                <h3>Problem Definition</h3>
                <p>The goal of this project is to classify different plant images by the species name. We have found multiple data sets of flower images obtained from Kaggle which may be combined to create a robust data set. These images that can then be combined with a list of toxic and non-toxic plant species to pets to form a final data set with which we will perform machine learning algorithms to predit the toxicity of a given plant image.</p>

                <br>

                <!-- Methods -->
                <h3>Methods</h3>
                <p>The methods we plan to use for the project include:<p/>
                <ul>
                    <li>Image Pre-Processing: Normalizing RGB values and reshaping image arrays</li>
                    <li>Categorizing toxic/nontoxic flowers to input into our data & respective algorithms</li>
                    <li>Unsupervised Learning (clustering): Grouping the images on idenitifable features</li>
                    <li>Supervised Learning (classification): We will use the x,y coordinates and RGB values of pixels as features within the images to classify each plant</li>
                    <li>We will most likely use python packages such as OpenCV and sklearn</li>
                </ul>

                <br>

                <!-- Potential Results -->
                <h3>Potential Results</h3>
                <p>First, we will classify each flower type which will then be used in determining toxicity; there are two separate outputs: flower is either toxic or nontoxic to dogs. In addition, we hope to determine if a correlation exists between species of toxic flowers.</p>

                <p style="margin-left:33%;"><b>Image 2:</b> Orchids are not toxic to dogs. </p>

                <!-- Discussion & Future Work -->
                <h3>Discussion & Future Work</h3>
                <p>One potential difficulty are collisions of toxic and nontoxic plants in our predictive model. Future expansions of the project could include classification with more variations of flowers and other types of plants. Furthermore, we could include more species of animals and categorize toxicity based on each species. In addition, the project could eventually classify crossbred flowers and identify the main parental species.</p>
